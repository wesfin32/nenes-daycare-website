3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed

## Contact Form Integration
The contact form currently shows a success message but doesn't actually send emails. To make it functional:

1. **Use Vercel's form handling:**
   - Add `netlify` attribute to form
   - No code changes needed

2. **Use Formspree or similar service:**
   - Sign up at formspree.io
   - Update form action URL
   - Add your endpoint

3. **Custom API endpoint:**
   - Create API route in `pages/api/contact.js`
   - Integrate with email service (SendGrid, etc.)
